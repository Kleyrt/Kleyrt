Hey there, name's Kleyrt.
I'm currently learning stuff and things needed to become a frontend dev. 
Not much to see here yet, since I also go to college (not related to anything dev- or even tech-like), which takes majority of my free time. 

Check back in like a year or two, maybe there'll be some cool stuff like a personal site or whatever. 
<br> Basically a placeholder readme for now
